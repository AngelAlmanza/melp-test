# Melp App
## This is a technical test for Exploration & Discovery Technologies.

### Notes for the reviewer
- The project is built using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Zustand for state management.
- The map functionality is implemented using React Leaflet.
- The UI components are styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- I did not use the endpoint provided in the original email as it was not working. Instead, I created a mock JSON file with restaurant data located at `public/data/data_melp.json`. The original endpoint URL blocked my requests with a CORS error.
- The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
